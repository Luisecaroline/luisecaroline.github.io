So there are many examples regarding the daily life, which could make it more comfortable. How could to do the laundry comfortable. It should be easy as just pushing a button and easy to arrange the laundry. And could a washing machine looking like another furniture?</p>

                                <p>The basket, which is the washing drum at the same time, can be placed directly into the washing machine. There is also enough place for a whole bottle of washing powder, so that the machine takes just as much of it, as it needs for the laundry inside. You have to refill it just once in a while. 
                                        Because of a RFID chip inside the basket, the washing machine knows already which programme it needs to run.</p>
