                <div>
                  <p>I was growing up near and in Rostock in northern Germany. Already sure about what I wanna do, I moved to Berlin in 2009 to study Product Design at the art academy Berlin Weissensee.<br>

                      While studying, I did an exchange semester in Israel at the Bezalel art academy in Jerusalem. And I gained first professional experiences in an Internship at Bosch Siemens.<br>
                      
                      I finished bachelor studies in 2014 and followed by that my master in 2016.
                      Next to my studies I took over some freelance projects in 3D-Visulisations for events and in graphic design especially for ElektroCouture. <br>
                      
                      While my master I already joined the start-up Nepos to work on a special tablet for seniors. Here I did design, user research and user testing. When it was about to get the hardware ready for production, I was asked to take over the responsibility of the design of the hardware and managing the communication in between the hardware departments. And so I did this as well. <br>

                      I love to challenge myself, learning new things and working in interdisciplinary teams.</p>
